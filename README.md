The Problem
Over 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted globally every year while millions go hungry. The gap isn't food — it's logistics. Donors don't know where to send food. Recipients don't know what's available. And no one is optimizing the routes.
The Solution
Food Rescue Optimizer connects food donors (restaurants, supermarkets) with recipients (food banks, shelters) and uses AI to plan the most efficient pickup and delivery routes — minimizing distance, saving fuel, and ensuring food reaches people before it spoils.
How It Works
Donor registers and submits available food items with quantity and expiry time
ML model scores spoilage risk instantly based on food category, temperature, and hours until expiry
AI optimizer assigns vehicles to pickups using constraint-based optimization
Routes are served via REST API for downstream apps to consume
Key Features
🤖 AI Route Optimizer — Timefold constraint solver assigns vehicles to pickups across 3 hard constraints: vehicle capacity, time windows, and distance minimization
🧠 ML Spoilage Scorer — logistic regression model (Smile library) predicts spoilage risk at submission time using food category, temperature, and hours until expiry
☁️ Cloud Native — containerized with Docker, deployed on AWS ECS Fargate with RDS PostgreSQL
🔄 CI/CD Pipeline — GitHub Actions automatically builds, tests, and redeploys on every push to main
📋 API Documentation — Swagger/OpenAPI interactive docs with all 11 endpoints
🗄️ Zero Schema Drift — versioned Flyway migrations ensure identical database state from local to production
✅ Tested — unit tested with JUnit 5 and Mockito

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java 21
Docker + Colima (Mac) or Docker Desktop
PostgreSQL
Run Locally
colima start
docker compose up -d
./mvnw spring-boot:run
Run Tests
./mvnw test
Demo Data
<!-- TODO: add V4__seed_demo_data.sql with sample donors, recipients, vehicles, and food items -->
Once the seed migration is in place, a fresh clone loads the demo dataset automatically via Flyway — then call POST /api/optimize to watch the solver work.

Every push to main automatically:
Sets up Java 21
Builds with mvn clean package
Builds the Docker image and pushes it to Amazon ECR
Triggers a new deployment of the ECS service
